Webgaze is a simple browser-based tool for quickly putting together a basic HTML page using an intuitive and visual editor. Webgaze is intended for smaller or less involved projects where a simple template is needed and a tool like webflow is overkill.

### TODO:

* Finish building out editor functionality
* Add more usable HTML elements
* Implement export feature
